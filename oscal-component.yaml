          The CLI can be used in CI/CD pipelines to assist with the resource authoring process to ensure they conform to standards prior to them being deployed.

          Use of auditing validationFailureAction state in a test environment would allow changes to be tested against policies without blocking development. Allowing for policies to be mirrored and enforced in production.

          Kyverno can be configured for cluster-wide and namespaced policies for system configuration. Exceptions can be implemented to policies that will allow for explicit deviations approved by policies/configurations declared in git.

          Kyverno can enact policies that prevent the use of specific service types (IE, LoadBalancer or NodePort).

          Policies can be written to validate all software workloads can be verified against a signature.

        control-id: sc.5
        description: >-
          Policies can be written to limit the effects of a denial of service attack.
          For example, when a Pod requests an emptyDir, by default it does not have a size limit which may allow it to consume excess or all of the space in the medium backing the volume. 
          This can quickly overrun a Node and may result in a denial of service for other workloads. This policy adds a sizeLimit field to all Pods mounting emptyDir volumes, if not present, and sets it to 100Mi.

        description: >-
          Policies can be written to Kubernetes Namespaces as a feature that provide a way to segment and isolate cluster resources across multiple applications and users. As a best practice, workloads should be isolated with Namespaces.

          Policies can be written to the boundary needed for incoming (ingress) and outgoing (egress) traffic and configure a network policy and/or a constraint configuration.

          Policies can be written to get block outgoing (egress) traffic to a specific external network. Configure a network policy and/or a constraint configuration.

          JMESpath can be used to set specific parameters of time, and Kyverno policies can be used to terminate a connection based on those parameters.
